## Steps to create an android signed APK starts

# Step 1: Generating an upload key

- You can generate a private signing key using keytool. 

# On Windows 
- keytool must be run from C:\Program Files\Java\jdkx.x.x_x\bin.
- Run: (Admin)
`$ keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore my-upload-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000`
This command prompts you for passwords for the keystore and key and for the Distinguished Name fields for your key. It then generates the keystore as a file called my-upload-key.keystore.
Note â€“ 
The keystore contains a single key, valid for 10000 days. The alias is a name that you will use later when signing your app, so remember to take note of the alias.

# On Mac
- if you're not sure where your JDK bin folder is, then perform the following command to find it:
`$ /usr/libexec/java_home`
- It will output the directory of the JDK, which will look something like this:
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdkXX.X_XXX.jdk/Contents/Home
- Navigate to that directory by using the command $ cd /your/jdk/path and use the keytool command with sudo permission as shown below.
`$ sudo keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-upload-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000`

Note: Save this keystore file on some loaction of your system
